# Experiment 2: Animals/Vehicles task 3

Participants are asked to learn what type of animals/vehicles are preferred by customers in two different pet/vehicle shops in a between groups design (blocked vs interleaved).
We train participants on one domain and evaluate their performance on the domain they were trained on, as well as a new domain.
We don't give feedback on test trials.
We predict that they perform better at test after blocked training
