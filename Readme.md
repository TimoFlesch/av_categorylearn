# Animals/Vehicles Task 1

Participants are asked to learn what type of animals/vehicles are preferred by customers in two different pet/vehicle shops.  
This is a between group design, where we compare the impact of blocked vs interleaved training on interleaved test performance.  
Participants are either trained on the vehicles or on the animals dataset.  
The participant is a buyer on behalf of the store, and you can buy / not buy, with rewards and punishments if a bought item sells/doesn't sell.
