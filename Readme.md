# Animals/Vehicles task

Participants are asked to learn what type of animals/vehicles are preferred by customers in two different pet/vehicle shops


## Todo list

### Stimuli
- update file load routines (flow load js...)

### Trials

1. data: implement temp/final data saver
<!-- 1. visuals: fixation cross during cue and feedback interval -->
<!-- 1. visuals: remoev overlap between response visuals and stimulus, move pos params to expt_parameters.js file -->
<!-- 1. visuals: context blue/orange shops (background images) with blue/orange frames. bg image blurred after ctx period  -->
<!-- 1. visuals: dark frame around stimulus image, to create stronger contrast -->
<!-- 1. visuals: UNDO THIS keep ctx blurred during resp and feedback period (looks better). perhaps decrease blur lvl -->
<!-- 1. logic: prevent expt from continuing once stopExperiment has been called -->
1. logic: fix domain selector and context images
1. visuals: cpoy accept/reject pngs from granada exp (no arrows underneath?)    
- fix response window issue that was brought up by Egnerites 

### instructions, consent, feedback forms
- import forms from rating task (updated ethics sheets)
- write cover story: own pet shops / vehicle shops
- update block-specific instructions (expt_parameters.js)

## codebase semantics
- replace "garden" with "shop"
- replace "tree" with "stimulus"
