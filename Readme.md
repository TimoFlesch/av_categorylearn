# Animals/Vehicles task 2

Participants are asked to learn what type of animals/vehicles are preferred by customers in two different pet/vehicle shops.  
Again, this is a between group design. However, this time we train participants on stimuli from one domain (for example Animals) and test them on stimuli from the other domain (e.g. vehicles). During test, we give feedback only on congruent trials.  The prediction is that blocked training facilitates transfer to incongruent trials more than interleaved training.
