      <p>Congratulations! You're done with the experiment.</p>
      <p> Before we proceed with payment, we'd like to ask you for some feedback! </p>
      <p>Probably, you came up with a pretty good idea how to solve the task</p>
      <p>As we had mentioned at the beginning of the experiment, your task was to figure out the rules
      that determine which button you'd have to press as response for each store</p>
      <p> Could you please write down the rules that you used to solve the task in each of the two boxes below? </p>

      <textarea rows="8" cols="40" id="userNorthOrchard" placeholder="which type of items did you accept in the BLUE store? What was the rule that determined how much reward you'd get?"></textarea>
      <p>
      </p>

      <textarea rows="8" cols="40" id="userSouthOrchard" placeholder="which type of items did you accept in the ORANGE store? What was the rule that determined how much reward you'd get?" ></textarea>

      <p> Once you have done this, hit the "Submit Answer" button and we'll proceed with payment.</p>
