      Before running the task, we will require you to read, understand and agree with a consent form, read carefully the guidelines describing what you will have to do.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, we need to ask you to <b>run the whole task in fullscreen</b> and <b>focus exclusively on the task</b> you are about to do. This is very important - so please close all "chat" applications, games, etc..<br>
      <br>
      At any time before you get your verification code, <b><a style="color:#FF0000">if you leave the fullscreen mode, the task will be cancelled and you'll need to start again!</a></b> Changing the resolution of your display will have the same unfortunate effect!<br>
      If you have any technical issue while running the task, please put yourself in contact with neuronoodle@gmail.com and let us know what happened! Don't forget to specify the task you are running (see the title of this website).<br>
