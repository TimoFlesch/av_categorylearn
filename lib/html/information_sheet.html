    <h2>Information for participants</h2>

    <p>Thank you for being willing to participate in our experiment.  Your 
    contribution to our research is very valuable and we appreciate your 
    help.</p>

    <h3>What are these experiments about?</h3>
    <p>We are interested in understanding how people make decisions.  In 
    particular, we are interested in how people use knowledge that they have
     gained from past experience and how they apply it to new situations.</p>

    <h3>Who is conducting these experiments?</h3>
    <p>The experiments are being conducted by Prof Christopher Summerfield of the University of Oxford, England.  The team can be contacted by e-mail on neuronoodle@gmail.com</p>

    <h3>What if I have a question?</h3>
    <p>We welcome questions about the project.  If you have any questions, please email Dr Summerfield on neuronoodle@gmail.com</p>

    <h3>What will we ask you to do?</h3>
    <p>You will read some instructions before starting the experiment. We will also give you a reminder of what to do when the experiment starts.</p>

    <h3>Will these experiments reveal anything about my personality?</h3>
    <p>No.  The data we get from you will be pooled with the data from other
     participants.  That is because we are looking for trends that only 
    emerge when a lot of data are analyzed.  In any case, we can't infer 
    anything about your individual personality from these data.</p>

    <h3>How will my data be used?</h3>
    <p>All we are recording is what key you press (or where you click on the screen)
    while you are performing the task, and also at what 
    time relative to the start of the experiment.  We collect no personal data other 
    than that.  At the end of each block, we save your data in a temporary file.
    When you get to the end of the experiment, the data will be 
    pooled with those of many other participants.  We will then use the 
    pooled data to test our theories about learning and decision making.  
    Only the members of the Summerfield laboratory stated above have access to your 
    data.  At the end of the project the data will be archived in case a 
    query about the research arises after the results of the project are 
    analysed and published.</p>

    <h3>What are the risks and benefits of the research?</h3>
    <p>There are no risks associated with the research.  If successful, the 
    project will hopefully result in a paper being published, so that other 
    scientists can build on our work.  In other words, it will help everyone
     understand better how people learn and make decisions.</p>

    <h3>What should I do if I have a complaint?</h3>
    <p>This project has been reviewed by, and received ethics clearance 
    through, the University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics 
    Committee.  If you have a concern about any aspect of this project, 
    please send an email to neuronoodle@gmail.com indicating which
    project you have participated in.  We will do our best to answer your query.
    If you remain unhappy and wish to make a formal complaint, please contact
    Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford (ethics@medsci.ox.ac.uk;
    Medical Sciences Inter-Divisional Research Ethics Committee, Medical Sciences Divisional 
    Office, Level 3 John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK </p>

    <h3>What if I don't like the experiment once I have started?</h3>
    <p>You can stop any time just by closing the program. However, you won't receive a verification code and thus we won't be able to reimburse you for your effort.</p>
