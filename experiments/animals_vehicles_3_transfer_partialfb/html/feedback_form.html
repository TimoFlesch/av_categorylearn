      <p>Congratulations! You're almost done with the study.</p>
      <p>
        Before we proceed with the rating task, we'd like to ask you for some
        feedback!
      </p>
      <p>
        Probably, you came up with a pretty good strategy to perform well on the
        task.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we had mentioned at the beginning of the experiment, your task was to
        figure out the rules that determine which button you'd have to press in
        each store.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could you please write down the rules that you used to solve the task in
        each of the two boxes below?
      </p>
      <p>
        Please describe in the first box which feature of the animals/vehicles
        determined the reward in the BLUE stores.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please describe in the second box which feature of the animals/vehicles
        determined the reward in the ORANGE stores.
      </p>

      <textarea
        rows="8"
        cols="40"
        id="userBlueShop"
        placeholder="which feature determined whether or not you received a reward in the BLUE stores?"
      ></textarea>
      <p></p>

      <textarea
        rows="8"
        cols="40"
        id="userOrangeShop"
        placeholder="which feature determined whether or not you received a reward in the ORANGE stores?"
      ></textarea>

      <p>
        Once you have done this, hit the "Submit Answer" button and we'll
        proceed with the short rating task.
